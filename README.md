# The Charisma Gallery Demo repository!

## Purpose

To create a extremely simple but powerful, user-friendly, "set it and forget it" online gallery with content management system based in Node.js, to allow site owners / operators use of this platform-agnostic content management system for CRUD operations with near-zero technical expertise.

## Technolgies / Packages Used

    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL,
    mysql2, multer, express-session, bcrypt, and dotenv

## Goals 
- Simple, clean front-end and UI.
- Use a Node.js and Express server
- Use MySQL for the database
- Ensure the user never has to use special software or advanced technical knowledge to administer their site content
- Provide the user with their own "administrative panel", baked-in to their website, and not rely on any third-party software or hosting company provided UI 
- Be responsive and look great through a "mobile-first" approach
- Be secure (dotenv obfuscation, "security through obscurity", and more)

## Features
- [x] Lightweight UI loads quick and responds fast, and works great on any mobile or desktop browser
- [x] The Gallery automatically customizes each view to the content of your database.  Upload something new, and it's immediately available!  This functionality instantly makes paying a web developer to update your site each time a thing of the past!
- [x] Automatic upload and removal of gallery content text and imagery through stand-alone, first-party administrative inteface that lives right inside your hosting space&mdash;you'll never need to use your FTP client or touch your hosting-providers "solutions" again!
- [x] Update content text (like descriptors, statements, statistics, display/hide, etc.) through the singular, familiar admin interface&mdash;no learning curve required!
- [x] Want to hide content without deleting it entirely?  That's as easy as changing a singular drop-down menu option!  The visitor-facing UI will instantly and automatically hide that content from all visitor views.  Keep your database up to date while showing only the items you wish to feature!
- [x] "Security through obscurity" administrative interface point-of-entry keeps potential bad actors guessing.
- [x] SQL-based session tracking, password hashing, and authentication mechanisms allow for login / logout functionality that keeps your administrative interface secure.
- [x] All elements, colors, positions, displays, etc. are fully customizeable by me (Joe Gallina) at the time of setup.  Background images, gradients, and overall look-and-feel is completely up to you!

## Notes
This Demo is a stripped-down version of the full Charisma Gallery functionality.  Key SQL commands, routes, scripts, and functions have been disabled in one way or another, to prevent abuse to the Demo.  Much of the disabled code is present in this codebase&mdash;but simply "commented out"&mdash;to allow for viewing.
